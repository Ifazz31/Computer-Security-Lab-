## Task 4
1. Create a text file that has a size which is not multiple of 16. The size can be checked using `ghex`.
2. Now Encrypt using ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB mode.
3. But however, `ECB` & `CBC` algorithm made the size of encrypted file 32 Bytes which is a multiple of 16. So here padding is needed incase of these 2 algorithms.
